Introduction
======
This is the main folder for the files belonging to the first lab assignment of Cyber Data Analytics. The script that we used to generate the scatterplot for the first question can be found in the plotting folder, and is called scatterplot_question1.py. The white box algorithm and the scripts used can be found in the folder white_box. The fraud_detection_question2_question3 script contains the code for the rest of the questions.

How to use
------
The code requires Python 2.7 and the Python packages scikit-learn, imblearn and matplotlib to run. These in turn require numpy and scipy to function.

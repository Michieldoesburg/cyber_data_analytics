A red dot indicates a fraudulent transaction (these are only at the very left of the plot due to very little fraudulent transactions existing), while a blue dot indicates a benign transaction. Refused transactions are treated as benign in this case, as we needed to show all data points and we wanted to show that all confirmed fraudulent cases comply with our observation.}}{1}}

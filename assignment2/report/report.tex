\section{Familiarization with the data}
The dataset contains a total of 44 signals, with some being static values, other being sinusoid signals, and others being partially discrete (as in, they can rise or drop at certain points). L-signals tend to be more sinusoidal, F-signals tend to be "partially discrete", and S-signals are all binary signals.

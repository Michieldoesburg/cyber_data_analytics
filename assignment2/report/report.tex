\section{Familiarization with the data}
The dataset contains a total of 44 signals, with some being static values, other being sinusoid signals, and others being partially discrete (as in, they can rise or drop at certain points). L-signals tend to be more sinusoidal, F-signals tend to be "partially discrete", and S-signals are all binary signals.

All the signals together seem to have little correlation. Some combinations of signals are reasonably correlated: e.g. L\_T3 and P\_J302 have a 0.42 correlation coefficient. Moreover, the signal P\_J302 in figure~\ref{correlation} looks cyclic. A cyclic signal like this is much easier to predict than a `random' signal, since there is a rough base model that it adheres to. This signal's values are within a clear band at about 2-6 on the Y-axis. In such a case it is very easy to come up with a basic anomaly detection technique: if the signal moves outside this band this would be a clear sign of an anomaly. Plotting the mean error we saw for the ARMA prediction on signal L\_T1, we saw that there were only 2 cases were the error was greater than three times the standard deviation.

\section{ARMA}
The script \texttt{ARMA.py} learns a ARMA model for any particular sensor. The parameters for the model are determined by testing out different $p$'s and $q$'s and then looking at the AIC value of the fitted model. A lower AIC means a better fit.
